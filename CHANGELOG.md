## 1.2 (2024-09-13)
- This release adds the ability to cancel a transaction before payment is presented, as opposed to waiting for the reader to timeout. Simply call the new `cancelTransaction()` function after a transaction has begun but before the card is presented. If the reader is successully able to cancel the operation, the `charge()` function will throw a `CloverTransactionError` with a code of `.cancelled`. If a card has already been presented, the payment may be completedâ€” at which time, you may reverse the payment as needed.
- Also includes miscellaneous bug fixes and improvements.
